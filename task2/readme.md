To use this notwork class, first we need to run all of the first three cells.
Then we can run any of the following network structures to train them. We can also do some changes, like the layer number, nodes, dropoutrate, learning rate, training iteration, etc.
We can also call NeuralNetwork.predict() seperately to predict some certain data.
The .ipynb file was tested on the environment as listed in the requirements.py, but it should be able to run on any version.
